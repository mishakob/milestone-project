# milestone-project
First project for the Data Incubator

This is a simple Flask app that takes from a user an input of a stock ticker, accesses the Quandle Wiki database via API 
and creates a bokeh plot.  
The options are to plot the opening price, highest price and/or the closing price.  
The plotting period is always last month.
